    <h1>Porting Linux Assembly Programs to macOS</h1>

    <p>This article is about the details, when you are porting Linux i386 assembly programs to macOS i386 (not PowerPC or x86-64). I wrote this article by the time I was porting <a href="https://github.com/ruda/jonesforth-macintel">Jonesforth to MacIntel</a> in 2010, so it may not be much accurate today.</p>

    <p>The macOS assembler is <strong>Mach-O Assembler</strong> and let us use <strong>Mach-O</strong> for short. The Linux assembler is <strong>GNU Assembler</strong> or <strong>Gas</strong> for short. The good news is that Mach-O is much compatible to Gas and they both use AT&amp;T syntax.</p>

    <h2>Diferences between Mach-O and Gas</h2>

    <h3>Data types</h3>

    <p>Data types are identical to both assemblers with exception of <code>.int</code> type in Linux, that is <code>.long</code> in macOS.</p>

    <h3>Labels</h3>

    <p>Labels are declared in the same way for both assemblers, you can even use the forward/backwards (f/b) syntax. Here is an example from Jonesforth:</p>

<pre>	jnz 2f
	pop %eax
	push %ebx		// push &lt;&gt; 0 on stack, indicating negative
	dec %ecx
	jnz 1f
	pop %ebx		// error: string is only '-'.
	movl $1,%ecx
	ret

	// Loop reading digits.
1:	imull %edx,%eax		// %eax *= BASE
	movb (%edi),%bl		// %bl = next character in string
	inc %edi

	// Convert 0-9, A-Z to a number 0-35.
2:	subb $48,%bl		// &lt; '0'?
</pre>

<h3 id="macros">Macros</h3>

<p>Macros are defined within <code>.macro</code> and <code>.endm</code> statements. The  macro definition bellow is interchangeable between Linux and Mac.</p>

<pre>.macro NEXT
	lodsl
	jmp *(%eax)
.endm
</pre>

<p>Linux has named arguments for macros and uses backslash to refer the named argument, like <code>\reg</code> or <code>\foo</code>.</p>

<pre>.macro PUSHRSP reg
	lea -4(%ebp),%ebp	// push reg on to return stack
	movl \reg,(%ebp)
.endm
</pre>

<p>Argument macros in macOS are numbers with prefix <code>$</code>. The first argument is <code>$0</code>, the second is <code>$1</code> and so on. The especial name <code>$n</code> gives the total number of arguments. Note that you do not declare the arguments, you just use it in the body.</p>

<pre>.macro PUSHRSP
	lea -4(%ebp),%ebp	// push reg on to return stack
	movl $0,(%ebp)
.endm
</pre>

<p>The Mach-O syntax <code>$0</code> <code>$1</code> is a bit annoying because they are also used as pure constants, outside macros definitions. Gas can accept default values for arguments, but you cannot do this with Mach-O assembler.</p>

<h3 id="system-call">System Call</h3>

<p>The system call (syscall for short) numbers are totally different between Linux and macOS, even worse, they may change in the whole life of an Operating System.</p>

<p>Linux syscall is invoked with <code>int $0x80</code> instruction, all arguments goes into registers, then you set the register <code>EAX</code> with the number of the system call. At the end of syscall, the register EAX contains the return value.</p>

<pre>	xor %ebx,%ebx	// 0
	mov $1,%eax	// syscall: exit
	int $0x80
</pre>

<p>macOS syscall is invoked with instruction <code>int $0x80</code> but, because of FreeBSD inheritance, the arguments are placed into the stack and the register EAX has the appropriate system call number. At the end of syscall, the register EAX contains the return value.</p>

<pre>	push $0		// 0
	mov $1,%eax	// syscall: exit
	push %eax
	int $0x80</pre>

<p>The instruction <code>push %eax</code> above is just for <em>padding the stack</em>, because of <code>int $0x80</code> requirement. In practice, it is better to place <code>int $0x80</code> in this subroutine:</p>

<pre>_syscall:
	int $0x80
	ret</pre>

<p>And then call the routine like this example (exit 0):</p>

<pre>	push $0		// 0
	mov $1,%eax	// syscall: exit
	call _syscall</pre>
</pre>
